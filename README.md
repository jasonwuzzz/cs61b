# README
### Main Topics
- Tradeoffs in time and memory for a variety of methods for structuring data.
- Engineering knowledge and skils needed to build and maintian an moderately large programs.
- Java: The syntaxes of Java, Python, MATLAB, Scheme etc. are enormously different, but the underlying computational models are surprisingly similar. It is not intended as an exhaustive course on Java, creating Android apps, user interfaces, or graphics. (Alternatives, one-unit self-paced PL courses: CS9F for C++ and CS9G for Java)

### Environment
#### Course Github Repository
1. Get skeleton files of assignments.
2. Save work for the different CS 61B assignments.
3. Submit the assignments throught Github to Gradescope.

#### Gradescope
You can only run the grader 3 times an hour. This is to dissuade you from using the grader to debug your code, only making small changes between submissions.

#### Coding Environment & Text Editor
- IDE: **IntelliJ**, Eclipse, Netbeans
- Vim, Emacs, Sublime


### Course Structure
#### First point contact with topics (Small majoryty of learning)
1. Pre-recorded lecture videos and Live Q&A (3 per week)
2. [Readings](https://joshhug.gitbooks.io/hug61b), which are redundant with videos
3. Guides, a summary of each day's content and additional optional exercises

#### Practice the materials (Vast majoryty of learning)
1. Sections
    - Discussions (after watching Monday lecture): in-person Zoom sessions + worksheets focus material learn in the past week (1 hour per week)
    - Labs (after watching Wednesday lecture): in-person Discord sessions + specs with autograder (2 hours per week)
        - Lab 01 to Lab 05 provide with help on getting your computer set up and essential Java programming tools
        - Lab 06 to Lab 14 involve implementation of data structure or algorigthm described in lecture
2. Assignments
Start after watching the lecture corresponding to the release date of that assignments.
    - Homework (3 before each exam), conceptual assignments for exam preparation, a combination of multiple choice and fill-in-blanks questions on Gradescope
    - Programming Projects, (1 2 4) are completed by your own, except project 3
        - Project 0 (2048: Inro to Java) and 1 (Deques: Basic Design, Testing, and Code Review): relatively easier, taking less time and with greater levels of scaffolding
        - Project 2 (TBA: Design, Large Scale Implementation): spread over a long period of time
        - Project 3 (BYOW: Large Scale Design): capstone project in which designing a project from scratch
### Course Frames
#### Phase 1: Programming Intensive Introduction to Java (Week 1-4)
- Four labs to introduce various tools
- HW0, browser-based
- Project 0 and Project 1
- Midterm 1
#### Pahse 2: Data Structure (Week 5-10)
- Programming HW1 and exam-prep HW2 for applications and deeper insight into data structures
- Large solo Project 2
- Lab 5: Peer review on project ;, Two labs that implement data structures (hash table and BST); Remaining labs are focused on project 2
- Midterm 2
#### Phase 3: Algorithms and Software Engineering (Week 10-14)
- Project 3: Build Your Own World: An open ended project where you and a partner build a 2D world with physics according to your own design.
- Labs devoted to project
- One theory homework
